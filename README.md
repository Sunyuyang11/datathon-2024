Addressing the Opioid Crisis: Data-Driven Insights for Policy and Health Interventions
Drug overdose is a devastating reality affecting communities across the U.S. In 2019, overdose deaths reached 70,630, a 4.8% increase from the previous year. Opioids were responsible for 70.6% of these deaths, highlighting the urgent need for action.

The U.S. government has turned to data and analytics to find solutions. My team and I are tasked with providing insights to guide the development of better policies and health interventions to combat this crisis.

This project uses comprehensive datasets, statistical analysis, and data visualization to uncover the patterns driving the overdose epidemic. Our goal is to deliver actionable insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and community organizations.

Join us as we delve into the data and work towards reducing overdose deaths and offering hope to those struggling with addiction.
